NOTES
: Performed in English with hardcoded Japanese subtitles. Often labelled as the original broadway production, but this is the Japanese touring production with an American cast. There are 2 versions of this going around. One suffers from very dark video but has pretty good sound, and the other has great video but very tinny and compressed audio. (And has 15 seconds missing from Clare Leach\'s intro). Check with traders.

House-Cam

FORMAT

CAST
: Bonnie Langford (Peggy Sawyer), Richard Cuerdan (Billy Lawlor)

NOTES
: Note from Blvd-on-Sunset: This video has been widely mislabelled as \"2006 UK Tour\" for years and some traders are unaware of this. A show programme from the 1991 UK Tour confirms this. Recorded through the House camera with some static at bottom of screen, and some generational loss. B+

#### 42nd Street - Asian Tour (Shanghai) - September, 2007
{: .no_toc .d-inline-block }

House-Cam
{: .label .label-green }

FORMAT
: MP4 \| 720p \| 3.31 GB

CAST
: Kristen Martin (Peggy), Paul Gregory Nelson (Julian), Natalie Buster (Dorothy), Charles MacEachern (Billy), Veronica DiPerna (Annie), Chris Clay (Andy), Ira Denmark (Bert), Karen McDonald (Maggie), Rockford Sansom (Pat), Julie Rees (Phyllis), Lani Corson (Lorraine), Rob Ouellette (Oscar)

NOTES
: You can\'t make out the actor\'s faces. The sound is very clear and fed from the soundboard, but the tap sounds get watered out. It seems this particular performance is cursed with little mishaps here and there. Billy drops his walking stick a few seconds after his appearance when the mirror sequence finishes. A chorus member also slips during we\'re in the money. The ensemble who form into a circle for the mirror sequence form the circle on the right side of the stage (a foot way from the middle) but they move back into the middle a seconds later. The spotlighting on the actors is also very crude, sometimes they lag behind the actor\'s movements and don\'t follow them accurately.

#### 42nd Street - Second Non-Equity US National Tour - June 7, 2016

NOTES
: A fantastic capture of the current tour. The ensemble is the standout here; the dance numbers are absolutely incredible. There is no obstruction, just one quick dropout in act one, and only some slight washout in a few of the wider shots. It's filmed in 16:9, with a mix of wides, mediums, and close-ups. The sound is excellent. Includes curtain call, finale, and playbill scans.

NOTES
: Final Pre-Broadway Performance! Amazing show and so much fun. This is one of my new favorite shows and one of the funniest musicals I\'ve been to. The three ladies are insanely talented and command, own and steal the show. Stephanie\'s big number, \"Get Out and Stay Out\" will stun you. No obstructions and beautifully captured! A

NOTES
: **Act One only** of the Broadway opening night; shot in 16:9 widescreen. Coverups during \"9 to 5\", the second half of \"I Just Might\" and the scene right before \"Backwoods Barbie\" and about a minute at the end of the dream sequences; camera also wanders sometimes and heads in the wide shots when taper zoomed out to get the whole picture; DVD includes \"Get Out and Stay Out\" from the April 17th performance with Gaelen Gilliland as Judy.Well-shot from the orchestra. There is sometimes the top of a head at the bottom of the screen, but it never blocks Gaelen.

NOTES

CAST
: Allison Janney (Violet Newstead), Megan Hilty (Doralee Rhodes), Gaelen Gilliland (u/s Judy Bernly), Kathy Fitzgerald (Roz Keith), Marc Kudisch (Franklin Hart, Jr.), Andy Karl (Joe), Dan Cooney (Dick), Van Hughes (Josh), Jeremy Davis (Bob Enright), Jessica Lea Patty (u/s Maria), Ann Harada (Kathy), Lisa Howard (Missy), Michael X Martin (Tinsworthy), Karen Murphy (Margaret), Charlie Pollock (Dwight), Tory Ross (Daphne), Maia Nkenge Wilson (Anita)

NOTES
: **Ann Harada\'s last** performance. Super funny **blooper** when Gaelen\'s scarf got tangled in the wire of her mic, and Allison Janney struggled to untie it while trying to ad-lib her way out of it, and when she finally unties it, Allison dramatically collapses on a desk in exasperation.

NOTES
: Final performance! Filmed in 16:9 widescreen. Few obstructions. Only in the wide shots when there are two heads on either side of the frame, but filmer does his/her best to shoot around them. External audio fed into video from MD recorder, so audio is very clear. A mix of close-ups and wider shots when multiple people were on stage to see their interactions. This was a gut-wrenchingly sad performance. Most of the cast members were in tears at some point or another during the show. In particular, Stephanie was sobbing through \"I Just Might\" and Allison started sobbing at the end of \"One of the Boys\". A few minor ad-libs and mishaps. One being when Allison pulled out a tape measure during the urinals bit of \"One of the Boys\". The cast was sad but they were clearly trying to have the times of their lives and go out with a bang. And they fed off the audience energy which was insane and very supportive.
