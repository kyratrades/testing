#### 42nd Street - Tokyo, Japan - August, 1986
{: .no_toc .d-inline-block }

Pro-Shot
{: .label .label-green }

FORMAT
: VOB+smalls | MP4 \| 476p

COMMENTS
: I have two different versions, and will trade them out as one video but you must do so as well.

CAST

NOTES
: Performed in English with hardcoded Japanese subtitles. Often labelled as the original broadway production, but this is the Japanese touring production with an American cast. There are 2 versions of this going around. One suffers from very dark video but has pretty good sound, and the other has great video but very tinny and compressed audio. (And has 15 seconds missing from Clare Leach\'s intro). Check with traders.

{: .no_toc .d-inline-block }

House-Cam
{: .label .label-green }

FORMAT
: VOB+smalls

CAST
: Bonnie Langford (Peggy Sawyer), Richard Cuerdan (Billy Lawlor)

NOTES
: Note from Blvd-on-Sunset: This video has been widely mislabelled as \"2006 UK Tour\" for years and some traders are unaware of this. A show programme from the 1991 UK Tour confirms this. Recorded through the House camera with some static at bottom of screen, and some generational loss. B+

#### 42nd Street - Asian Tour (Shanghai) - September, 2007
{: .no_toc .d-inline-block }

House-Cam
{: .label .label-green }

FORMAT
: MP4 \| 720p \| 3.31 GB

CAST
: Kristen Martin (Peggy), Paul Gregory Nelson (Julian), Natalie Buster (Dorothy), Charles MacEachern (Billy), Veronica DiPerna (Annie), Chris Clay (Andy), Ira Denmark (Bert), Karen McDonald (Maggie), Rockford Sansom (Pat), Julie Rees (Phyllis), Lani Corson (Lorraine), Rob Ouellette (Oscar)

NOTES
: You can\'t make out the actor\'s faces. The sound is very clear and fed from the soundboard, but the tap sounds get watered out. It seems this particular performance is cursed with little mishaps here and there. Billy drops his walking stick a few seconds after his appearance when the mirror sequence finishes. A chorus member also slips during we\'re in the money. The ensemble who form into a circle for the mirror sequence form the circle on the right side of the stage (a foot way from the middle) but they move back into the middle a seconds later. The spotlighting on the actors is also very crude, sometimes they lag behind the actor\'s movements and don\'t follow them accurately.

#### 42nd Street - Second Non-Equity US National Tour - June 7, 2016 
{: .no_toc .d-inline-block }

SJ Bernly
{: .label .label-blue }

FORMAT
: VOB+smalls

CAST
: Caitlin Ehlinger (Peggy Sawyer), Matthew J Taylor (Julian Marsh), Kaitlin Lawrence (Dorothy Brock), Blake Stadnik (Billy Lawlor), Steven Bidwell (Bert Barry), Britte Steele (Maggie Jones), Mark Fishback (Abner Dillon), Natalia Lepore Hagan (Annie), Mallory Nolting (Phyllis Dale), Vanessa Mitchell (Lorraine Flemming), DJ Canaday (Pat Denning), Lamont Brown (Andy Lee), Rob Ouellette (Oscar), Alicia Newcom, Allison Blanchard, Andrew Winans, Brady Miller, Brittany Bigelow, Carlos Morales, Courtney Moran, Emily Blake Anderson, Georgina Moore, Joel Chambers, Kahlia Davis, Kelly Gleason, Lucia Foster, Mandy Modic, Matthew Alexander, Mitchell Canfield, Molly Jean Blodgett, Patrick Heffernan, Rob Ouellette, Sarah Fagan, Taylore Burke, Tommy Joscelyn, Tricia DeSario

NOTES
: A fantastic capture of the current tour. The ensemble is the standout here; the dance numbers are absolutely incredible. There is no obstruction, just one quick dropout in act one, and only some slight washout in a few of the wider shots. It's filmed in 16:9, with a mix of wides, mediums, and close-ups. The sound is excellent. Includes curtain call, finale, and playbill scans.
