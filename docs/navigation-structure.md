NOTES
: Final Pre-Broadway Performance! Amazing show and so much fun. This is one of my new favorite shows and one of the funniest musicals I\'ve been to. The three ladies are insanely talented and command, own and steal the show. Stephanie\'s big number, \"Get Out and Stay Out\" will stun you. No obstructions and beautifully captured! A

NOTES
: **Act One only** of the Broadway opening night; shot in 16:9 widescreen. Coverups during \"9 to 5\", the second half of \"I Just Might\" and the scene right before \"Backwoods Barbie\" and about a minute at the end of the dream sequences; camera also wanders sometimes and heads in the wide shots when taper zoomed out to get the whole picture; DVD includes \"Get Out and Stay Out\" from the April 17th performance with Gaelen Gilliland as Judy.Well-shot from the orchestra. There is sometimes the top of a head at the bottom of the screen, but it never blocks Gaelen.

NOTES
: One head in the way at times and the first couple of minutes of each act are blacked out; second half of \"I Just Might\" is very shaky and slightly blacked out; good sound throughout; nice clear video.

#### 9 to 5 - Broadway - June 21, 2009
{: .no_toc .d-inline-block }

juniper47
{: .label .label-blue }

FORMAT
: VOB+smalls

CAST
: Allison Janney (Violet Newstead), Megan Hilty (Doralee Rhodes), Gaelen Gilliland (u/s Judy Bernly), Kathy Fitzgerald (Roz Keith), Marc Kudisch (Franklin Hart, Jr.), Andy Karl (Joe), Dan Cooney (Dick), Van Hughes (Josh), Jeremy Davis (Bob Enright), Jessica Lea Patty (u/s Maria), Ann Harada (Kathy), Lisa Howard (Missy), Michael X Martin (Tinsworthy), Karen Murphy (Margaret), Charlie Pollock (Dwight), Tory Ross (Daphne), Maia Nkenge Wilson (Anita)

NOTES
: Filmed in 16:9 widescreen. Minor and only occasional obstruction from the woman sitting in front of me who kept leaning forward whenever she laughed at something. Virtually no blackouts (only during transitions) . External audio fed into video from two sources, so audio is clear. Good mix of close-ups and wider shots when multiple people were on stage to see their interactions.

: Gaelen makes a great Judy -- very different from SJB, but extremely solid and made the role her own. Allison and Megan were on top of their game as well. A FANTASTIC FLUB occurred when Gaelen's scarf got tangled on her microphone wire and it took Allison a very long time to untie it, and by that time, she'd ad-libbed her way out of it and then collapsed in a heap of laughter. It was definitely one of those moments you're glad to have captured on video!

NOTES
: Final performance! Filmed in 16:9 widescreen. Few obstructions. Only in the wide shots when there are two heads on either side of the frame, but filmer does his/her best to shoot around them. External audio fed into video from MD recorder, so audio is very clear. A mix of close-ups and wider shots when multiple people were on stage to see their interactions. This was a gut-wrenchingly sad performance. Most of the cast members were in tears at some point or another during the show. In particular, Stephanie was sobbing through \"I Just Might\" and Allison started sobbing at the end of \"One of the Boys\". A few minor ad-libs and mishaps. One being when Allison pulled out a tape measure during the urinals bit of \"One of the Boys\". The cast was sad but they were clearly trying to have the times of their lives and go out with a bang. And they fed off the audience energy which was insane and very supportive.

NOTES
: Performed in English with hardcoded Japanese subtitles. Often labelled as the original broadway production, but this is the Japanese touring production with an American cast. There are 2 versions of this going around. One suffers from very dark video but has pretty good sound, and the other has great video but very tinny and compressed audio. (And has 15 seconds missing from Clare Leach\'s intro). Check with traders.

NOTES
: You can\'t make out the actor\'s faces. The sound is very clear and fed from the soundboard, but the tap sounds get watered out. It seems this particular performance is cursed with little mishaps here and there. Billy drops his walking stick a few seconds after his appearance when the mirror sequence finishes. A chorus member also slips during we\'re in the money. The ensemble who form into a circle for the mirror sequence form the circle on the right side of the stage (a foot way from the middle) but they move back into the middle a seconds later. The spotlighting on the actors is also very crude, sometimes they lag behind the actor\'s movements and don\'t follow them accurately.

NOTES
: A fantastic capture of the current tour. The ensemble is the standout here; the dance numbers are absolutely incredible. There is no obstruction, just one quick dropout in act one, and only some slight washout in a few of the wider shots. It's filmed in 16:9, with a mix of wides, mediums, and close-ups. The sound is excellent. Includes curtain call, finale, and playbill scans.

NOTES
: Act one has three major blackouts: the scene between Arabian Nights and One Jump Ahead, the scene between One Jump Ahead and Proud of Your Boy, and the last 22 minutes of the act, which is all of Friend Like Me and Act One Finale. There is also a head that blocks center stage and the action is often lost behind it. Act two is much better with no blackouts and only some heads on the bottom that are worked around well. It's filmed in 16:9, with a mix of wides, mediums, and close-ups. There's a lot of chatter and rustling from the audience, but the sound is otherwise excellent. Includes playbill scans.

NOTES
: Really beautiful shot in an intimate space. Lots of zooms, but a good amount of wider shots too with a very limited (almost nonexistent) amount of heads. The lighting in this theater really liked my camera and I know the show almost "by heart" so I think I followed the action as well as possible. My battery died during the last song, but it starts at the very beginning with only one drop out during dialogue.

NOTES
: An adorable and charming new show premiering at Berkeley Repertory. Samantha, Adam, and Savvy are fantastic in their roles, the music is gorgeous, and the sets are beautiful and clever. A very nice capture with just one quick dropout and one small head that can occasionally be seen at the bottom of the screen but never blocks the action. It's filmed in 16:9, with a mix of wides, mediums and close-ups. The sound is excellent. The show runs 1 hour and 40 minutes with no intermission. Includes curtain call and playbill scans. A

NOTES
: This show is magical, Phillipa is captivating, and the entire ensemble is perfectly quirky. There have been a few changes since Berkeley that tighten up the show a bit and make it ready for Broadway. A near perfect capture with no washout, no obstruction, and just one very quick dropout. It's filmed in 16:9, with a mix of wides, mediums, and close-ups. The sound is excellent. Includes curtain call and playbill scans.

NOTES
: This first attempt at a sequel to Annie, Annie 2: Miss Hannigan\'s Revenge, opened at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. in December 1989 to universally disastrous reviews. Extensive reworking of the script and score proved futile, and the project ended before officially reaching Broadway; newly surfaced video was filmed from the balcony. Shot between heads, and the balcony railing is visible, but not too bad-you still get a good feel for the show. Recorded at the second night performance. Some generational loss. B

FORMAT
: VOB+smalls

CAST
: Patti LuPone (Reno Sweeney)

NOTES
: Usually labelled as the \"Almost\" Lost Footage of the Lincoln Center Revival from 1988. 20 minutes of footage shot on a single camera from a tripod, on stage right, of the following numbers: \"You\'re the Top,\" \"Easy to Love,\" \"I Want to Row on the Crew\" and \"There\'ll Always be a Lady Fair,\" with dialogue scenes between each song. This is not the poor video quality bootleg that is commonly shared, but is well filmed, with lots of close ups, but some generational loss. It could either have been press reel footage or an archival recording. It usually circulates along with An Evening with Patti LuPone, a PBS television special from 1997 at the Callum Theatre in the Palm Desert Resort hotel in Palm Springs, CA. This lasts around 90 minutes.
