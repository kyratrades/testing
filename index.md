### Trading
Online trading only. Contact me through <a href="mailto:kyratrades@gmail.com?subject=Trade%20request">kyratrades@gmail.com</a> with a list of the item(s) you're interested in. Make the list by copying the whole title on my site.

For example:
```yaml

2. Anything Goes - Third National Tour - March 23, 2013
3. ...

Audios:

```

If you already have other means of reaching me (Reddit, Discord etc.) you're welcome to use them too! Feel free to send a trade request for anything you want, I'll almost certainly find something from your list. However, I may decline a trade if you don't have your formats listed. I only trade for files in their original formats.

You must include a link to and/or an attachment of your list. Whoever initiates a trade will send their links first.

### Standard ratios

<center>1 audio - 1 audio</center>

<center>1 video - 1 video</center>

<center>2 audios - 1 video</center>

### Files
I do my best to check each of my items individually and will note down any issues. Please don’t hesitate to tell me of any problems you've encountered with my files or links, or if I have mislabelled anything.

Feell free to send enquiries about any items listed on my site.

### Wants
I'm always looking for any recordings of Megan Hilty, Stephanie J. Block, and Rachel York.

### Links
All the file sizes listed are calculated according to 1GB = 1024 MB. I mainly use Google Drive for my links, please don’t initiate a trade with me if you have problems with it. If I initiated the trade with you, I am more than happy to upload your requested files to any file sharing service of your choosing.
 
### Gifting policy
I got my start from a fair number of generous traders, so I’m always happy to help new traders out :) I’m also willing to gift most commercially released pro-shots upon request (especially NTLive and RSC), just ask!
