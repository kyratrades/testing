## Info

### No. of items listed:
Videos - 889
Audios - 191
Concerts - 24

### Trading
I'm open for general trades. Contact me through kyratrades@gmail.com. If you already have other means of reaching me (Reddit, Discord etc.) you're welcome to use them too!

Feel free to send a trade request for anything you want, I'll almost certainly find something from your list! However, I may decline a trade if you don't have your formats listed. Moreover, please keep in mind I only trade for files in their original formats.

### Files
I try my best to check each of my recordings individually (still catching up!) and will list any problems in the notes. Please don’t hesitate to tell me of any problems you've encountered with my files or links, or if I have something not in their original formats but haven’t listed so accordingly.

### Wants
I'm always looking for any recordings of Megan Hilty, Stephanie J. Block, and Rachel York.

### Trading
Online trading only. Send me a message (preferably through email), listing the item(s) you're interested in. Make the list by copying the whole title (e.g. "Wicked - Broadway - May 28, 2006"). You must include a link to and/or an attachment of your list. Whoever initiates a trade should send their links first.

### Links
All the file sizes listed are calculated according to 1GB = 1024 MB. I use both MEGA and Google Drive. Please don’t initiate a trade with me if you have problems with either host. If I initiated the trade with you, I am more than happy to upload your requested files to the online storage provider of your choosing.

If any of my links are down just send me a message about it and I will re-upload the files as soon as possible, usually within 12 hours.
 
### Gifting policy
I got my start from a fair number of generous traders, so I’m always happy to help new traders out :) I’m also willing to gift any commercially released pro-shots (in particular National Theatre Live) upon request, just say so in your message
